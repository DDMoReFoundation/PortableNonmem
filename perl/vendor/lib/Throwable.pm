#pod
#pod Throwable is implemented with L<Moo>, so you can stick to Moo or use L<Moose>
#pod as you prefer.

#pod This attribute is created automatically, and stores the value of C<$@> when the
#pod Throwable object is created.  This is done on a I<best effort basis>.  C<$@> is
#pod subject to lots of spooky action-at-a-distance.  For now, there are clearly
#pod ways that the previous exception could be lost.

=head1 NAME

Throwable - a role for classes that can be thrown

=head1 VERSION

version 0.200011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Redirect;
  use Moose;
  with 'Throwable';

  has url => (is => 'ro');

...then later...

  Redirect->throw({ url => $url });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as exceptions to
standard program flow.  It is very simple and does only two things: saves any
previous value for C<$@> and calls C<die $self>.

Throwable is implemented with L<Moo>, so you can stick to Moo or use L<Moose>
as you prefer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 previous_exception

This attribute is created automatically, and stores the value of C<$@> when the
Throwable object is created.  This is done on a I<best effort basis>.  C<$@> is
subject to lots of spooky action-at-a-distance.  For now, there are clearly
ways that the previous exception could be lost.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 throw

  Something::Throwable->throw({ attr => $value });

This method will call new, passing all arguments along to new, and will then
use the created object as the only argument to C<die>.

If called on an object that does Throwable, the object will be rethrown.
