=head1 NAME

File::HomeDir -- get home directory for self or other users

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::HomeDir;
  print "My dir is ", home(), " and root's is ", home('root'), "\n";
  print "My dir is $~{''} and root's is $~{root}\n";
   # These both print the same thing, something like:
   #  "My dir is /home/user/mojo and root's is /"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a function, C<home>, and also ties the
in-all-packages variable C<%~>.

=over

=item home()

Returns a filespec to this user's home directory.

=item home($user)

Returns a filespec to the home directory of the given user, or undef
if no such user.

Note that the argument to this must be a defined value, and mustn't be
a zero-length string, or a fatal error will result.

=item C<$~{$user}>

=item C<$~{username}>

=item C<"...$~{$user}...">

=item C<"...$~{username}...">

This calls C<home($user)> or C<home('username')> -- except that if you
ask for C<$~{some_user}> and there is no such user, a fatal error
results!

Note that this is especially useful in doublequotish strings, like:

     print "Jojo's .newsrc is ", -s "$~{jojo}/.newsrc", "b long!\n";
      # (helpfully dies if there is no user 'jojo')

If you want to avoid the fatal errors, first test the value of
C<home('jojo')>, which will return undef (instead of dying) in case of
there being no such user.

Note, however, that if the hash key is "" or undef (whether thru being
a literal "", or a scalar whose value is empty-string or undef), then
this returns zero-argument C<home()>, i.e., your home directory:

=item C<$~{""}>

=item C<$~{undef}>

=item C<"...$~{''}...">

These all return C<home()>, i.e., your home directory.

=back

If running under an OS that doesn't implement C<getpwid>, this library
tries to provide a sane return value for the no-argument C<home()>.
Under MacOS, for example, it tries returning the pathspec to the
desktop folder.  See source for full details.

Under OSs that don't implement C<getpwnam> (as C<home($user)> calls),
you will always get a failed lookup, just as if you'd tried to look up
the home dir for a nonexistent user on an OS that I<does> support
C<getpwnam>.

=head1 BUGS AND CAVEATS

* One-argument C<home($username)> is memoized.  Read the source if you
need it unmemoized.

* According to the fileio.c in one version of Emacs, MSWindows (NT?)
does have the concept of users having home directories, more or less.
But I don't know if MSWin ports of Perl allow accessing that with
C<getpwnam>.  I hear that it (currently) doesn't.

#|          /*
#|           * Emacs wants to know the user's home directory...  This is set by
#|           * the user-manager, but how do I get that information from the
#|           * system?
#|           *
#|           * After a bit of hunting I discover that the user's home directroy
#|           * is stored at:  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\security\\sam\\"
#|           * "domains\\account\\users\\<account-rid>\\v" in the registry...
#|           * Now I could pull it out but this location only contains local
#|           * accounts... so if you're logged on to some non-local domain this
#|           * may run into a security problem... i.e. I may not always be able
#|           * to read this information even for myself...
