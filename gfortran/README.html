<h1>Welcome to the GNU Fortran 95 compiler!</h1>

<p>This document intends to provide you with basic information about gfortran, the GUN Fortran 95 compiler,
and links to further documentation about the compiler and the Fortran language.</p>


<h3>Using gfortran</h3>

<ul><li>Our <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranGettingStarted">Getting Started</a> page inside the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran wiki</a>. This will give you the basics about gfortran (main command-line options, file extensions, etc.)</li>

<li>This distribution includes a copy of the gfortran documentation <a
href="doc/gcc-4.6.0/gfortran/index.html">in HTML format</a> and <a
href="doc/gfortran.pdf">in PDF format</a> (also available online, <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/">HTML</a> or <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran.pdf">PDF</a>). Other docs,
such as the C compiler and preprocessor documentations, as well as the
GCC and gfortran internals documentations, can be found in the <a
href="doc/"><code>doc/</code></a> directory.</li>

<li>This documentation includes a list of <a
href="doc/gcc-4.6.0/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html">GCC general
options</a> (shared by gfortran), as well as <a
href="doc/gcc-4.6.0/gfortran/Invoking-GNU-Fortran.html">options
specific to gfortran</a>



</ul></li>


<h3>Getting help</h3>

There are a few places where you can find people willing to help you...

<ul><li>the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.fortran"><code>comp.lang.fortran</code></a> newsgroup on Usenet: people around there discuss fortran, and will be glad to offer you help and advice on any Fortran-related topic. Beware, though: it's know to be a place where discussions sometimes get heated!</li>

<li>the gfortran mailing-list (<a href="mailto:fortran@gcc.gnu.org">send a mail</a> or <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/fortran/">search in the archives</a>): it's the main place for discussions about gfortran. We'll help you use gfortran and answer your questions about the compiler.</li>

<li>the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">GCC bugzilla</a>: if you found a bug in the compiler, please report it here with detailled instructions about how to reproduce it, the compiler version and your OS version.</li>

</li></ul>


<h3>Useful links</h3>

<p>We maintain an online <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html#fortran">list of links and selected readings</a> about Fortran. Please help yourself!</p>

<h3>Source code for the utilities included in this package</h3>

<p>This package contains more than just the GNU Fortran compiler. All the
utilities included in here are open source, and as such, you are entitled
to download their source code, look at it, modify it and redistribute it
as long as you abide by their licence (which means, most of the times,
that you cannot use them in such a way that doesn't offer the same
freedom). For your convenience, and in keeping with the terms of the GNU
Public Licence, here is the list of utilities included in this package
and where you can download the source that was used to compiler them:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">GNU binutils</a>
version 2.20 (source code <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/GNU%20Binutils/binutils-2.20/binutils-2.20-1-mingw32-src.tar.gz/download">here</a>).</li>

<li><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/">GNU gdb</a> version 6.6
(source code <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=2435&filename=gdb-6.6-mingw-src.tar.bz2">here</a>).</li>

<li>MinGW and MSYS runtimes environments, headers and development tools
are <a href="http://mingw.org/licensing.shtml">public domain</a>, and you
can download their sources <a

<li>Last but not least, this package is built with GCC development
sources, which will become the 4.6.x release series. The revision number
of the sources used for this build is 161045, and you can download
those sources with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
as revision 161045 of <code>svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk</code>.
This is usually done with the following commande line: <code>svn -q
checkout -r 161045 svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc</code>.</li>
